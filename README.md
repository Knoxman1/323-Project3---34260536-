# Project 3 Patterns 


I did not Fork the existing GitHub repository as I faced many challenges while trying to I couldnt find a link and the project 
Connected the Web App to the data source in the appsettings.json file using my azure databes connection string

# Design Pattern Implementation
Certainly, design patterns are essential for maintaining code organization, readability, and scalability in software development. In your project, you have identified the need to implement repository classes to manage data access operations related to Orders, Customers, and Products. This is a great opportunity to apply design patterns to ensure clean and maintainable code.

Here's a detailed explanation of how design patterns can be implemented in your project:

1. **Repository Pattern**:
   - **Purpose**: The Repository Pattern separates the logic that retrieves data from the database from the rest of the application. It provides a clean API for data access.
   - **Implementation**:
     - You are creating repository classes for Orders, Customers, and Products. These classes will encapsulate all data access operations related to their respective entities.
     - Each repository class should have methods to perform common data operations like Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD).
     - For example, the `OrdersRepository` class will have methods like `GetOrderById`, `CreateOrder`, `UpdateOrder`, and `DeleteOrder`.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Code separation: Data access logic is isolated in repository classes, making it easier to manage and test.
     - Reusability: The same data access methods can be reused across different parts of your application.
     - Maintainability: Changes to data access logic can be made in one place, reducing the risk of errors.

2. **Dependency Injection**:
   - **Purpose**: Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that allows you to inject dependencies (like your repository classes) into the classes that depend on them.
   - **Implementation**:
     - In your `OrderDetailsController`, you are injecting an instance of `IOrderDetailsRepository`. This is a good practice because it promotes loose coupling and testability.
     - Using DI, you can easily switch between different implementations of `IOrderDetailsRepository` (e.g., for unit testing) without modifying your controller.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Testability: You can easily mock dependencies for unit testing.
     - Flexibility: It's easier to change or extend the behavior of your application by swapping out dependencies.

3. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - **Purpose**: This design principle encourages dividing your application into distinct sections or layers, each responsible for a specific aspect of functionality.
   - **Implementation**:
     - In your project, the separation of concerns is evident. You have controllers responsible for handling HTTP requests, repository classes for data access, and a data layer (Entity Framework) for interacting with the database.
     - Each component has a specific role, making it easier to understand, modify, and maintain.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Maintainability: Changes and updates to one component don't affect others as long as the interfaces remain the same.
     - Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on different parts of the application simultaneously.

4. **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**:
   - **Purpose**: The MVC pattern separates the application into three interconnected components: Model (data), View (user interface), and Controller (logic).
   - **Implementation**:
     - In your project, the MVC pattern is evident. Controllers (e.g., `OrderDetailsController`) handle user input and orchestrate interactions, Views (e.g., Razor views) display data, and Models (e.g., `OrderDetail`) represent the data.
     - This separation helps maintain a clean and organized codebase.
   - **Benefits**:
     - Code organization: Each component has a specific role, making the codebase more organized and easier to maintain.
     - Scalability: Adding new features or views is more straightforward because of the separation of concerns.

In summary, the implementation of design patterns like the Repository Pattern, Dependency Injection, Separation of Concerns, and MVC in your project promotes code organization, maintainability, and testability. These patterns help you manage data access operations efficiently and ensure that your application remains flexible as it evolves.
